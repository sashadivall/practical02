1. Atomicity: A transaction is treated as an atomic unit, meaning it is fully executed or not executed at all.
2. Consistency: A transaction takes a database from one consistent state to another consistent state, ensuring that all data meets integrity constraints.
3. Isolation: Two transactions cannot affect each other, even if they are being executed concurrently.
4. Durability: Once a transaction is completed and committed successfully, its changes are permanent and preserved even in the event of a system failure.

In essence, ACID Compliance ensures that database transactions are reliable, consistent, and free from concurrency issues, providing a robust foundation for data management."
